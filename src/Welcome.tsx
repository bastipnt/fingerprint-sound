        This website is a draft for a project of my masters thesis about <i>targeted advertising</i>{" "}

        terms with your mouse and they will be explained.

        I'm sure you have already heared about <InfoText infoText={cookiesInfo}>cookies</InfoText>?{" "}
        <i>Cookies</i> can be used for <i>tracking</i>! But <i>cookies</i> are not cool anymore, the
        tracking industry came up with a much better approach to track people's online behaviour.
        Let me introduce to you{" "}

        page.

        You can imagine a device fingerprint (also called browser fingerprint) similar to a real
        fingerprint in the sense that both are unique.
      </p>
      <p>
        A device fingerprint is an identifier that can track your used device across multiple web
        pages. It doesn't need to store any information on your computer to be able to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the great advantage compared to <InfoText infoText={cookiesInfo}>cookies</InfoText>.
        To create a <i>fingerprint</i> all that needs to be done is to combine information about
        your browser and device, that can be accessed with{" "}
        <InfoText infoText={javaScriptInfo}>JavaScript</InfoText>. The information used is chosen
        wisely in a way that it doesn't change often and provides maximum{" "}
        <InfoText infoText={enthropyInfo}>entropy</InfoText>.

      </span>
      <p>
        The aim of this website is providing a non technical way to teach about web tracking and
        especially device fingerprinting.
      </p>
      <p>
        After this introduction you can experience the often invisible device fingerprint yourself.
        I picked six attributes that are usually used for device fingerprinting. These attributes
        can be used on the next page to create sounds and visuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each attribute may sound boring on its own but all attributes together will create a whole
        composition. Just as attributes in a device fingerprint don't provide much value on their
        own, combined they can identify a person.
